      <p>
        Hi, I’m Carla, a software developer with over 6 years of experience building and
        maintaining web applications. I work across front-end, back-end, and cloud
        infrastructure, mostly with React, .NET, and Azure.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve worked on digital products and internal platforms, dealing with legacy code,
        production issues, and day-to-day engineering tradeoffs. I care about code that is
        understandable, testable, and cheap to change.
